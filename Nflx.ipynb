    "Upon initial examination of the dataset, several areas for data cleaning and standardization were identified:\n",

    "- **Incomplete and Misformatted Titles**:\n",
    "  - The titles of the tables appeared incomplete and misformatted, likely due to the data scraping process or a lack of post-processing.\n",
    "  - Titles with extraneous numbers and letters, not conveying meaningful information, were cleaned for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Type Correction for 'Year' and 'Date'**:\n",
    "  - Initially, 'Year' and 'Date' fields were set as integers (`int`), leading to incorrect display in visualizations (e.g., '2018' displaying as '2,018').\n",
    "  - To rectify this, these fields were converted to string data type. This ensures correct representation and avoids misinterpretation in visualizations, while keeping the data suitable for year-based grouping and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Column Name Standardization**:\n",
    "  - Identified spaces in column names could lead to compatibility issues with certain data analysis tools.\n",
    "  - For improved readability and adherence to standard data processing practices, spaces in column names were replaced with underscores (`_`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Integrity Check**:\n",
    "  - A comprehensive check for null values was conducted across all tables to ensure data completeness.\n",
    "  - The examination revealed no missing data, as indicated by the null value counts (e.g., 'Year' and 'Revenue' columns showing zero null values), confirming the dataset's integrity for analysis.\n",

    "Throughout this project, I encountered a series of challenges related to correcting the titles of data sheets. My journey to finding an effective solution involved several attempts and taught me a valuable lessons about data exploration and preparation with Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 align=\"center\">Initial Attempts with Code and Excel</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code-Based Solutions**: Initially, I attempted to fix the titles directly through code. This approach seemed promising but unfortunately did not yield the desired results. The modifications I applied in the code were not correctly reflected in the output, leading to the first roadblock.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Manual Adjustments in Excel**: As a next step, I tried renaming the titles manually within Excel. To my surprise, this method also failed. The changes either didn't save properly or reverted upon reloading the file, adding to the complexity of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 align=\"center\">A Shift in Strategy: Conversion to JSON</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Faced with persistent challenges, I began to suspect intrinsic attributes in the dataset that resisted modification. This led me to consider a different approach: converting the Excel file to JSON format. My hypothesis was that a JSON representation might bypass these potential constraints.Upon converting the data to JSON, I was able to successfully implement the title changes. This step was crucial as it suggested that the issue lay not with the data itself, but possibly with the Excel environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 align=\"center\">Understanding Excel's Limitations</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The breakthrough moment came when I discovered a critical limitation in Excel: the maximum character limit for sheet names is 31 characters. This realization was pivotal—it explained why some title changes were not being applied, especially for longer names like 'Netflix annual revenue by regio' and 'Netflix annual subscribers by r'.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- I modified my approach to shorten these titles while still maintaining their descriptiveness and clarity. This simple yet crucial adjustment was the key to resolving the title issues.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<h3 align=\"center\">Reflections</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Had I known about Excel's character limit earlier, I could have directly shortened the titles in Excel, circumventing the need for a roundabout solution. This experience underscored the importance of understanding the tools and environments I work with.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The journey, although filled with obstacles, was enlightening. It offered practical insights into problem-solving and adapting strategies to align with software constraints.\n"
